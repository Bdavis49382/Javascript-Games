# Javascript-Games

# Mission
This website is intended to be a portfolio of games I've created using javascript, html, and css.

# Games Available:
 -Snake: Slither around, eat apples, and try not to die. A mostly finished product, but don't press too many keys at once!
 -Boggle Practice: See how many of the possible words you can find on a classic boggle board. Takes a very long time to load right now.

# Games In Progress/Future Projects:
 -some kind of complex logistical game
 -a multiplayer word game
